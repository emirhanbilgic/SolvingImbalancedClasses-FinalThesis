# Solving Imbalanced Classes in Machine Learning - Final Thesis

## Overview
This final thesis project focuses on addressing the challenge of imbalanced classes in machine learning datasets. Our primary case study utilizes an Alzheimer's dataset which can be accessed through the following Kaggle link:

[Alzheimer's Dataset - 4 Class of Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images)

## Project Structure
The project is structured into three main phases:

### 1. Hyperparameter Optimization
Utilize Hyperopt to conduct hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance.

### 2. Data Adjustment
Implement techniques for adjusting the dataset to better handle class imbalances, which is the central focus of this thesis.

### 3. Ensemble Learning
Apply ensemble learning methods to improve prediction accuracy by combining several models.

## Objective
The goal of this thesis is to develop and evaluate strategies that mitigate the impact of imbalanced classes in a dataset, thereby improving the efficacy of machine learning models in practical applications.
